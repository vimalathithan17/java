/*
 1. Create a base class called `BankAccount` with attributes like `accountNumber`,
`accountHolderName`, and `balance`. Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing
money. Then, create two subclasses, `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`, which inherit
from the `BankAccount` class. Add specific attributes and methods to each subclass. For
example, `SavingsAccount` might have an `interestRate` attribute, and `CheckingAccount` could
have a `monthlyFee` attribute. Demonstrate how you can create instances of these subclasses and
perform transactions.
